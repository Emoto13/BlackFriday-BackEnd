# BlackFriday-Backend
Backend of a client-server online shop. Written in Django/ Django REST.

- Currently consists of 3 apps - users, orders, products.
- Still under development.
- Features into consideration:
    * Refactor search view using django filtering library (currently the queries are inefficient)
    * Views need testing
    * Images could (should) be stored in Mongo or S3.
